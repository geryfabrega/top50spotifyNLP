Olivia Rodrigo,drivers license,"I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
Today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street"

You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Looking at the table and I see the reason why
Baby, you living the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right
Cocaine and drinking with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend

I wanna feel on yo' ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from fucking and flying
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm riding
Oh, oh, oh, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shining on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm acting hella elite
Never want the niggas that's in my league
I wanna fuck the ones I envy, I envy
Cocaine and drinking with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend

Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark

Singing in harmony

To all her friends, saying you're so unique, hmm
So when you gonna tell her
That we did that, too?
She thinks it's special
But it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah), hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
Do you call her
Almost say my name?
'Cause let's be honest
We kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
I'll bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singing it together
Now I bet you even tell her
How you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (ooh) (I love you)
So when you gonna tell her
That we did that, too?
She thinks it's special
But it's all reused

Played you the song she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? Oh

If you wanted you can take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando

Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind
I can read your mind
What you want to do
It's written all over your face times two

I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe

Just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly
Ain't it funny
All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid?
Ain't it funny?
Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid

This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all

Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so

Hicimos poses que yo más nunca hice
Tú te mojaste pa que yo me bautice

Esos ojitos tienen un misterio
Pero al final nada de lo nuestro fue en serio

The Neighbourhood,Sweater Weather,"And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand in California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh
Oh, she knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste, yeah
These hearts adore, everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land

Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carried on

But I ran out of every reason
Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason
Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
What did you think would happen?
What did you think would happen?
I'll never let you have it
What did you think would happen?
Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
(You broke me first)
You broke me first, oh"

Qué tan loco sería
Si yo fuera el dueño de tu corazón por solo un día
Si nos gana la alegría, yo por fin te besaría
¿Qué pasaría?
Podría ser entre él y yo, ¿quién ganaría?
Mi condición; enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño
Y el no tenerte me hace daño
Seríamo' la pareja del año
Cuánto te extraño
Sin condición
Me enamoré, precisamente, de una chica que no es mía
Y mis amigos lo sabían
Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías
Si me dieran solo 24 hora', yo la' aprovecho
Jura'o que yo voy a hacerte cosa' que nunca te han hecho
Ya yo me cansé de ser amigo' con derecho'
Yo tal ve' no te merezco, pero no hay ni que decirlo
Si no' juntamo' seríamo' la pareja del siglo
Con ella acapella me da con introducirlo
Navaja doble filo
Cortamo' y lo' video' me dio con reproducirlo'
Me lo decían, yo los ignoraba
Simplemente, todo ahora quedó en la nada
Se lo hacía y a los ojo' la miraba
Yo nunca creía que el amor cegaba
Mi condición; enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño
Y no tenerte me hace daño
Seríamo' la pareja del año
Cuánto te extraño
Sin condición
Me enamoré, precisamente, de una chica que no es mía
Y mis amigos lo sabían
Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías
Asumí mi depresión de ver una foto tuya
Y verte en la televisión puede ser que me destruya la mente
Detente, como dice la canción
Que no meten preso a nadie por robarse un corazón
Sufriendo, llorando de pena
Que no vea mi llanto, no vale la pena
Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas
Te vuelves la mala de nuestra novela
Me tienes sufriendo, llorando de pena
Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena
Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas
Me quitas la pista y me quedo acapella
Mi condición; enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño
Y el no tenerte me hace daño
Seríamo' la pareja del año
Cuánto te extraño
Sin condición
Me enamoré, precisamente, de una chica que no es mía
Y mis amigos lo sabían
Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías
Yo tenía otra melodía
De lo que resultaría
Maldita monotonía
¿Fue culpa tuya o fue culpa mía? (seríamo' la pareja del año)
Yo aprendí a vivir con celos (con celos)
Tú aprendiste a no ser mía (no-oh)
Solo queda ser sincero
Yo te quiero todavía
